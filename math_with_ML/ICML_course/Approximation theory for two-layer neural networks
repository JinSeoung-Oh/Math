## Approximation theory for two-layer neural networks
Consider “scaled” two-layer neural networks:
   f_m(x; θ) = 1/m [sigma j=1 to j=m] a_j σ(w^T_j x),  σ(t) = max(0, t)

What class of functions are well-approximated by two-layer neural networks?
Integral representation: Consider functions
f : x=[0,1]^d |→ R of the form
f(x) =
