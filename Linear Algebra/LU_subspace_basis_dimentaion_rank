## LU factorization
Let A be a square matrix. A factorization of A as A = LU, where L is unit lower trianglular and U is upper triangular
is called an LU factorization of A

** If A is a square matrix that can be reduced to row echelon form withouth using any row interchanges. Then A has an LU factorization.

** If A is an invertible matrix that has an LU factorization, then L and U are unique

## P^tLU factorization
Let A be a square matrix. A factorization of A as A=p^tLU, where P is a permutation matirx, L is unit lower triangular, and U is upper
triangluar, is called a P^tLU factorization of A.

** If P is apermutation matrix, then P^-1 = P^t

** Every square matrtix has a P^tLU factorization

## Subspaces
A subspace of R^n is any collection S of vectors in R^n such that:
1. The zero vector 0 in in S
2. If u and v in S, then u+v is in S (S is closed under addition)
3. If u is in S and c is a scalar, then cu is in S (S is closed under scalar multiplication)

** Let v_1, v_2 , ... , v_k be vectors in R^n. Then span(v1, v2, .. ,vk) is a subspace of R^n

** Let A be an mxn matrix.
1. The eow space of A is the subspace row(A) of R^n spanned by the rows of A.
2. The column spca of A is the subspace col(A) of R&m spanned by the columns of A.

** Let A ba an mxn matrix and let N be the set of solutions of the homogeneous linear system Ax=0. Then N is a subspace of R^n

** Let A be an mxn matrix. The null space of A is the subspae of R^n consistin of solutions of the homogeneous linear system Ax = 0.
Ut us denoted by null(A)

## Basis
A basis for a subspace S of R^n is a set of vectors in S that
1. spans S 
2. Linearly independent

Process
1. Fund the reduced row echelon form R of A.
2. Use the nonzero row vectors of R (containing the leadinig 1s) to form a basis for row(A)
3. Use the column vectors of A that correspond to the columns of R containing the leading 1s(the pivot columns) to form a basis for clo(A)
4. Solve for the leading variables of Rx = 0 in terms of free variables, set the free variables equal to parameters, 
substitute back into x, and write the result as a linear combination of f vectors (where f is the number of free variables)
These f vectors form a basis for null(A)

** The Basis Theorem
Let S be a subspace of R^n. Then any two bases for S have the same number of vectors

## Dimention
If S is a subspace of R^n, then the number of vectors in a basis for S is called thee dimension of S, denoted dim S 

## Rank
The rank of a matrix A is the dimension of its row and column spaces and is denoted by rank(A)

**For any matrix A
rank(A^T) = rank(A)

** The nullity of a matrix A is the diemnsion of its null space and is denoted by nullity(A)

** The Rank Theorem
If A is an mxn matix, then rank(A) + nullity(A) = n

# Let A be an mxn matrix, then:
a. rank(A^tA) = rank(A)
b. the nxn matrix A^tA is invertible if and only if rank(A) = n

# Let S be a subspace of R^n and let B = {v1, v2, ... ,vk} be a basis for S. For every vector v in S,
there is exactly one way to write v as a linear combination of the basis vectors in B:
v = c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3 + ... + ckvk

# Let S be a subspace of R^n and let B = {v1, v2, ... , vk} be a basis for S.
Let v be a vector in S, and write v = c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + ckvk.
Then c1, c2, .. , ck are called the coordinates of v with respect to B, and column vector
      |c1|
      |c2|
[V]B =|c3| 
      |..|
      |ck|
is called the coordinate vector of v with repect to B
