## LU factorization
Let A be a square matrix. A factorization of A as A = LU, where L is unit lower trianglular and U is upper triangular
is called an LU factorization of A

** If A is a square matrix that can be reduced to row echelon form withouth using any row interchanges. Then A has an LU factorization.

** If A is an invertible matrix that has an LU factorization, then L and U are unique

## P^tLU factorization
Let A be a square matrix. A factorization of A as A=p^tLU, where P is a permutation matirx, L is unit lower triangular, and U is upper
triangluar, is called a P^tLU factorization of A.

** If P is apermutation matrix, then P^-1 = P^t

** Every square matrtix has a P^tLU factorization
