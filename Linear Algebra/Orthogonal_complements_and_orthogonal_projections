## Orthogonal complements
Let W be a subspace of R^n. We say that a vector v in R^n is orthogonal to W if v is orthogonal to every vector in W.
The set of all vectors that are orthogonal to W is called the orthogonal complements of W, denoted W^ㅗ. That is, 
W^ㅗ = {v in R^n : v ⋅ w = 0   for all w in W}


# Let W be a subspace of R^n
a. W^ㅗ is a subspace of R^n
b. (W^ㅗ)^ㅗ = W
c. W ∩ W^ = {0}
d. If W = span(w_1, ..., w_k), then v is in W^ㅗ if and only if v ⋅ w_i = 0 for all i = 1, ... , k


# Let A be an mxn matrix. Then the orthogonal complement of the row space of A is the null space of A, and the orthogonal complements of the column space of A is the null space of A^T:
(row(A))^ㅗ = null(A)  and  (col(A))^ㅗ = null(A^T)


## Orthogonal projections
Let W be a subspace of R^n and let {u_1, ... , u_k} be an orthogonal basis for W. For any vector v in R^n, the orthogonal projection of v onto W is defined as
proj_w(v) = (u_1 ⋅ v / u_1 ⋅ u_1)u_1 + ... + (u_k ⋅ v / u_k ⋅ u_k)u_k
The component of v orthogonal to w is the vector
perp_w(v) = v - proj_w(v)


# The orthogonal Decomposition Theorem
Let W be a subspace of R^n and let v be a vector in R^n. Then there are unique vectors w in W and w^ㅗ in W^ㅗ such that
v = w + w^ㅗ = proj_w(v) + perp_w(v)
*If W is a subspace of R^n, then (W^ㅗ)^ㅗ = W

# If W is a subspace of R^n, then
dim W + dim W^ㅗ = n
*The rank Theorem : If A is an mxn matrix then rank(A) + nulity(A) = n
