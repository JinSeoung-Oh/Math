## The dot Product
if u is (n,1) matrix ans v is (n,1) matrix
then uÂ·v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + ... + u_nv_n

## The Cross Product
The cross product of u = [u_1, u_2, u_3] is (3,1) matrix and v = [v_1, v_2, v_3] is (3,1) matrix
then u X v = [u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1] is (3,1) matrix
