## Let A and B be nxn matrices. We say that A is similar to B if there is an invertible nxn matrix P such that P^-1AP = B
If A is similar to B, we write A~B


## Let A,B and C be nxn matrices.
a. A ~ A
b. If A~B, than B~A
c. If A~B and B~C, then A~C


## Let A and B be nxn matrices with A~B. Then
a. detA = detB
b. A is invertible if and only if B is invertible
c. A and B have the same rank
d. A and B have the same characteristic polynomial
e. A and B have the same eigenvalues


## An nxn matrix A is diagonalizable if there is a diagonal matrix D such that A is similar to D 
That is, if there is an invertible nxn matrix P such that P^-1AP = D


## Let A be an nxn matrix. Then A is diagonalizable if any only if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.
More precisely, there exist an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that P^-1AP = D 
if and only if the columns of P are n linearly independent eigenvectors of A and the diagonal entries of D are the eigenvaluies
of A corresponding to the eigenvectors in P in the same order.


## Let A be an nxn matrix and let λ1, λ2, ... , λk be distinct eigenvalues of A. IF B_i is a basis for the eigenspace Eλ,
Then B = B_1 U B_2 U ... U B_K (i.e., the total collection of basis vectors for all of the eigenspaces) is linearly independent


## If A is an nxn matrix with n distinct eigenvalues, then A is diagonalizable


## If A is an nxn matrix, then the geometrix multiplicity of each eigenvalue is less than or equal to its algebraic multiplicity


## The Diagonalization Theorem
Let A be an nxn matrix whose distinct eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, ... , λk.
The following statements are equivalent:
a. A is diagonalizable
b. The union B of the bases of the eigenspaces of A contains n vectors
c. The algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue equals its geometric multiplicity
