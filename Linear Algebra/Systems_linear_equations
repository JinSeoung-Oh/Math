## A Linear equation in the n variables x_1, ... , x_n is an equation that can be wtiyyen in the form
a_1x_1 + a_2x+x_2 + .. a_nx_n = b
where the coefficients a_1 , ... a_n and the constant term b are constans

## sysyem of linear equation is a finite set of linear equations, each with the same variables

## Consistent system --> has a unique or infinitely many solution
## Inconsistent system --> has no solution

## equivalent --> Two linear system are called equivalent if they have the same solution sets

## back substitution --> Starting from the last equation(has a unique solution) and working backward(to get soultion of the other equations) 

## Augmented matrix
ex ) x-y-z=2 / 3x-3y+2z=16 / 2x-1y-z=19
     
     |1 -1 -1|2
     |3 -3  2|16
     |2 -1 -1|19

## Row echelon form
1. Any rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom
2. In each nonzero row, the first nonzero entry(called the leading entry) is a column to the left of any leading entries below it
ex) |2 4  1|
    |0 -1 2|
    |0  0 0|
    
## Elementary row operation
1. interchange two rows
2. multiply a row by a nonzero constant
3. add a multiple of a row to another

## Row equivalent
Matrices A and B are row equivalent if there is a sequence of elementary row operation that converts A into B / A and B can be reduced to same row echelon form

##Gaussian Elimindation
1. Write the augmented matrix of system of linear equations
2. Use elementaty row operation to reduce the augmented matrix to row echelon form
3. using back sunstituion, solve thr quivalent systme that corresponds to the row-reducd matrix

## leading variables --> the variables corresponding to the leading entries in row echelon form / free variables --> the other variables 
if the number of free variables is zero than it has unidue solution)

## Rank
The rank of matrix is the number if nonzero rows in its row echelon form

## The rank theorem
Let A be the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations with n variables. If the system is consistent, than
number of free variables = n - rank(A)

## reduced row echelon form
1. It is in row echelon form
2. The leading entry in each nonzero row is a 1 (called leading 1).
3. Each column containing a leading 1 has zeros evert wehre else
**The reduces row echelon form of a matrix is unique (unlike row echelon form) 

## Gauss-Jordan Elimination
1. Write the augmented matrix of the system of linear equations
2. Use elementray row operations to reduce the augmented matrix to reduced row echelon form
3. If the resulting system is consistent, solve for the leading variables in terms of any remaining free variables.
********************************************
x + 2y - z = 3
3x + 3y + z = 1

|1 2 -1  3|   -->  |1  0  5  -7| 
|2 3  1  1|        |0 -1 -3   5|

last cloumn has no pivot
So replace last cloumn z (free vadiables)

x + 5z = -7
y - 3z = 5
* z = t (free vadiables)

Then
|x| = |-7| + t|-5|
|y| = | 5| + t| 3| 
|z| = | 0| + t|1|

## Homogeneous
A system of linear equations is called homogeneous if the constant term in each equations iz zero.
--> [A|0]
if [A|0] is a homogeneous system of m(number of equation) linear equations with n(number of variable) variable, where m<n, then the system has infinitely many solutions 
--> Cus the linear equations has free variable

## system of linear equations with augmented matrix [A|b] is consistent if and only if b is a linear combinations of the columns of A.

## Sapnning set
Is S={v_1, ... , v_n} is a set of vector in R_n, then the set of all linear combinations of v_1, .. ,v_n is called the span of v_1,...,v_n
and is denoted by span(v_1,...v_n) or span(S). If span(S) = R^n, then S is called a spaning set of R_n

If given arbitary vector is [a b] and given span(S) = ([2 -1], [1 3])
And if x[2 -1] + y[1 3] = [a b] can always be solved for x and y(in terms of a and b), regardless of the values of a and b

## linearly dependent
A set of vectors v_1, ..., v_k is linearly dependent if there are scalars c_1, .. ,c_k at least one of which is non zero, such that
c_1v_1 + c_2v_2, ... , c_kv_k =0
**linear independence means that the zero vector can be expressed as a linera combinaiion of v_1, v_2, .. , v_k only in the "trivial way":
c_1v_1 + ... c_kv_k =0 only if c_1 =0 , c_2=0 ,.. , c_k=0

## linearly independent
A set of vectors that is not linearly dependent

## Vectors v_1, ... , v_m in R_n are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others

## Let v_1, ... , v_m be (column) vectors in R_n and let A be the nxm matrix [v1 v2 .. vm] which these vectors as its coluimns.
Then v_1, ... , v_m are linearly dependent if and only if the homogeneous linear system with augmented matrix [A|0] has nontrivial solution

## Let v_1, v_2, ... , v_m be (row) vectors in R_n and let A be the mxn matrix with these vectors as its rows. Then v_1, v_2 , ... ,v_m are 
linearly dependent if and only if rank(A) < m 

## Any set of m vectors in R_n is linearly dependent if m>n
