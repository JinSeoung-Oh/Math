#Lines and Planes
## The **normal** from of the equation of a plane P in R^3 is
n·(x-p) = 0 or n·x = n·p
where p is a specific point on P and n != 0 is a normal vector for P.

The general form of the equation of P is ax + by + cz =d, where n = [a,b,c] (shape 3,1 not 1,3) is a normal vector for P

## The **vector** from of the equation of a plane P in R^3 is
x = p+su+tv / x-p = su+tv
where p is a point on P and u and v are direction vectors for P (u and v are non-zero and parallel to P, but note parallel mto each other)
The equations corresponding to the components of the vector form of the equation are called parametric equations of P
