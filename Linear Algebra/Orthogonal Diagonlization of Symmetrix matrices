## A square matrix A is orthogonally diagonalizable if there exists an orthogonal matrix Q and a diagonal matrix D such that Q^TAQ = D
** Diagonalizable --> P^-1AP = D


# If A is orthogonally diagonalizable, then A is symmetric (A = A^T)


# If A is real symmetric matrix, then the the eigenvalues of A are real


# If A is a stmmetric matrix, then any two eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of A are orthogonal


## The Spetral Theroem
Let A be an nxn real matrix. Then A is symmetric if and only if it is orthogonally diagonalizable.

* Sepctral decomposition
A = λ1q1q1^T + λ2q2q2^T + ... + λnqnqn^T
