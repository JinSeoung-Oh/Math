## A set of vectors {v_1, v_2, ... , v_k} in a vector space V is linearly dependent if there are scalars c_1, c_2, ... , c_k at leat one of which is not zero
such that 
c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_kv_k = 0
A set of vectors that is not linearly dependent is said to be linearly independent

## A set of vectors {v_1, v_2, ... , v_k} in a vector space V is linealy dependent if and only if
at least one of the vectors can be expresed as a linear combination of the others

## A set S of vectors in a vector space V is linearly dependent if it contains finitely many linearly dependent vectors.
A set of vectors that is not linearly dependent is said to be linearly independent.

## A subset B of a vector space V is a basis for V if
1. B spans V and
2. B is linearly independent

## If e_i is the i_th colmn of the nxn identity matrix, then {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n} is a basis for R^n, called the standard basis for R^n

## {1, x, x^2, ... , x^n} is a basis for P_n, called the standard basis for P_n

## The set E = {E_11, ... , E_1n, E_21, ... , E_2n, E_m1, ... , E_mn} is a basis for M_mn, where the matrices E_ij are as:
E_11 = | 1 0 0 | ,    E_12 = | 0 1 0 | , ...
       | 0 0 0 |             | 0 0 0 |
       
E_21 = | 0 0 0 | ,    E_22 = | 0 0 0 | , ...
       | 1 0 0 |             | 0 1 0 |
       
E is called the standard basis of M_mn.


## coordinates
Let V be a vector pace and let B be a basis for V. For every vector v in V, there is exactly one way to write v as a linear combination of the basis vector in B

Let B = {v_1, v_2, .. , v_n} be a basis for a vector space V. Let v be a vector in V, and write v = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n. 
Then c_1, c_2, ... , c_n are called the coordinates of v with respect to B, and the column vector
[v]_B = |c_1|
        |c_2|
         ...
        |c_n|
is called the coordinate vector of v with respect to B


## Let B = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n} be a basis for a vector space V. Let u and v be vectors in V and let c be a scalar. Then
a. [u+v]_B = [u]_B + [v]_B
b. [cu]_B = c[u]_B


## Let B = {v_1, v_2, ... , v_n} be a basis for a vector space V and let u_1, ..., u_k be vectors in V.
Then {u_1, ..., u_k} is linearly independent in V if and only if {[u_1]_B, ..., [u_k]_B} is linearly independent in R^n


## Let B = {v_1, v_2, ... , v_n} be a basis for a vector space V
a. Any set of more then n vector in V must be linearly dependent
b. Any set of fewer then n vector in V cannot span V.


## The Basis Theorem
If a vecor space V has a basis with n vectors, then every basis for V has exactly n vecotrs


## A vector space V is called finite-diemensional if it has a basis consisting of finitely many vectors.
The diemension of V< denoted by dim V, is the number of vectors in a basis for V.
The dimension of the zero vector space {0} is defined to be zero. A vector space that has no finite basis is called infinite-dimensional


## Let V be a vector space with dim V = n, then:
a. Any linearly independent set in V contains at most n voectors
b. Any spanning set for V contains at least n vecotrs
c. Any linearly independent set of exactly n vectors in V is a basis for V
d. Any spanning set for V consisting of exactly n vectors is a basis for V
e. Any linearly independent set in V can be extended to a basis for V
f. Any spanning set for V can be reduced to a basis for V


## Let W be a subspace of a finit-diemensional vector space v. Then:
a. W is finite-dimensional and dim W <= dim V
b. dim W = dim V if and only if W = V
