## An inner product on a vecotor space V is an operiton that assigns to every pari of vectors u and v in V a real number <u,v> such that following peoperties hold for all vectors u,v and w in V and all scalars c:
1. <u,v> = <v,u>
2. <u,v+w> = <u,v> + <u,w>
3. <cu, v> = c<u,v>
4. <u,u> >= 0 and <u,u> = 0 if and only if u = 0
A vector space with an inner product is called an inner product space


## Let u,v and w be vectors in an inner product space V and let c be a scalar
a. <u+v,w> = <u,w> + <v,w>
b. <u, cv> = c<u,v>
c. <u,0> = <0,u> = 0


## Let u and v be vectors in an inner product space W
1. The length (or norm) of v is ||v|| = np.root(<v,v>)
2. The distance between u and v is d(u,v) = ||u-v||
3. u and v are orthogonal if <u,v> = 0


## Let u and v be vectors in an inner product space V. Then u and v are orthogonal if and only if
||u+v||^2 = ||u||^2 + ||v||^2


## Orthogonal Projections and the Gram-Schmidt Process
An orthogonal set of vectors in an inner product space V is a set {v_1, ... , v_k} of vectors from V such that <v_i, v_j> = 0 wherever v_i != v_j
An orthonormal set of vectors is then an orthogonal set of unit vectors. An orthogonal basis for a subspace W of V is just a basis for W that is an orthogonal set
Similarly, an orthonormal basis for a subspace W of V is a basis for W that is an orthonormal set

# Legendre polynomials
A system of complete and orthogonal polynomials with a vast number of mathematical properties and numerous applications (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials)

# normalized Legendre polynomials
Divide each of polynomials by its lenth relative to the same inner product

# Orthogonal projection 
orthogonal proejction proj_w(v) of a vector v onto a subspace W of an inner product space. If {u_1, ... , u_k} is an orthogonal basis for W, then
proj_w(v) = (<u_1,v>/<u_1,u_1>)u_1 + ... + (<u_k, v> / <u_k, u_k>)u_k

# component of v orthogonal to W
Perp_w(v) = v-proj_w(v)


## The cauchy-Schwarz Inequalities
Let u and v be vectors in an inner product space V. Then
|<u,v>| <= ||u||||v||
with equality holding if and only if u and v are scalar multiples of each otehr


## The Triangle Inequality
Let u and v be vectors in an inner product space V. Then
||u+v|| <= ||u|| + ||v||
