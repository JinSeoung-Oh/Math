## If u = |u_1| and v = |v_1| are vectors in C^n(complex space), then the complex dot product of u and v is
          |...|         |...|
          |u_n|         |v_n|
definded by
uâ‹…v = __             __
     u_1v_1 + ... + u_nv_n
     
     
## If A is a complex matrix, then the conjugate transpose of A is the matrix A* defined by
A* = ___
     A^t
     

## A square complex matrix A is called Hermitan if A* = A 
that is, if it is equal to its own conjugate transpose


## A squre complex matrix U is called unitray if U^-1 = U*


## A squre complex matrix A is called unitarily diagonalizable if there exists a unitary matrix U and a diagonal matrix D such that
U*AU = D


## A square complex matirx A is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if
A*A = AA*


## Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality (AMGM)
n_root(x1x2,..,xn) <= (x1+ ... + xn)/n
with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = ... = xn
