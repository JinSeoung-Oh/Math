## The singular values of a matrix
If A is an mxn matrix, the singular values of A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of A^tA and are denoted
by σ_1, ... , σ_n. It is conventional to arrange the singular values so that
σ_1 >= σ_2 >= ... >= σ_n


## The singular values Decomposition
Let A be an mxn matrix whith singular values σ_1>= σ_2>= ... σ_r>0 and σ_r+1 = σ_r+2 = ... = σ_n = 0.
Then there exist an mxm orthogonal matrix U, an nxn orthogonal matrix V, and an mxn matrix ∑ of the form shown
in equation 
A = U∑V^t
The columns of U are called left singular vectors of A, and the columns of V are called right singular vectors of A


## The outer Product Form of the SVD
Let A be an mxn matrix with singular values σ_1>= σ_2>= ... σ_r>0 and σ_r+1 = σ_r+2 = ... = σ_n = 0.
Let u_1, ... , u_r be left singular vectors and let v_1, ... , v_r be right singular vectors of A
corresponding to these singular values. Then
A = σ_1u_1(v_1)^t + ... + σ_nu_n(v_n)^t


## Let A = U∑V^t be a singular value decomposition of an mxn matrix. Let σ_1, ... , σ_r be all the nonzero singular values of A.
Then:
a. The rank of A is r
b. {u_1, ... , u_r} is an orthonormal basis for col(A)
c. {u_(r+1) , ... u_m} is an orthonormal basis for null(A^t)
d. {v_1, ... , v_r} is an orthonormal basis for row(A)
e. {v_(r+1), ... , v_n} is an orthonormal basis for null(A)


## Let A be an mxn matrix with rank r. Then the image of the unit sphere in R^n under the matrix transformation
that maps x to Ax is
a. the surface of an ellipsoid in R^m if r=n
b. a solid ellipsoid in R^m if r<n


## Frobenius norm of a matrix
Let A be an mxn matrix and let σ_1,σ_2, ... ,σ_r be all the nonzero singular values of A
Then
||A||_F = root((σ_1)^2 + ... + (σ_r)^2)
If A is an mxn matrix and Q is an mxm orthogonal matrix, then
||QA|||_F = ||A||_F


## The Pseudoinverse and Least squares approximation
Let A = U∑V^t be an SVD for an mxn matrix A, where ∑ = |D  O|
                                                       |O  O|
and D is an rxr diagonal matrix containing the nonzero singular values σ_1>= σ_2>= ... σ_r>0 of A.
The pseudoinverse (or Moore-Penrose inverse) of A in the nxm matrix A^+ defined by
A^+ = U(∑^+)(U^+)
where ∑^+ is the nxm matirx
∑^+ = |D^-1  O|
      |O     O|
      
# The least squares problem Ax=b has a unique least squares solution i of minimal length that is given by
i = A^+b
