##  Markov Chains
1. If P is the nxn transition matrix of a Markov chain, then 1 is an eigenvalue of P

2. Let P be an nxn transition matrix with eigenvalue λ
a. |λ| =< 1
b. If P is regular and λ != 1, then |λ| < 1

3. Let P be a regular nxn transition matrix. If P is diagonlizable, then the dominant elgenvalue λ_1 = 1 has algebraic multiplicity 1

4. Let P be a regular nxn transitin matrix. Then as k --> infitinte , P^k approaches an nxn matrix L whose columns are identical,
each equal to the same vector x. This vector x is a steady state probability vector P

5. Let P be a regular nxn transitin matrix, with x the steady state probability vector for P, as in 4. Then, for any initial probability vector x0,
the sequence of iterates x_k approaches x

6. Every Leslie matrix has a unique positive eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector with positive components
** The Leslie matrix is a discrete, age-structured model of population growth that is very popular in population ecology named after Patrick H. Leslie

## The Perron-Frobenius Theorem
# Perron's Theorem
Let A be a positive nxn matrix. Then A has a real eigenvalue λ_1, with the following properties:
a. λ_1 > 0
b. λ_1 has a corresponding positive eigenvector.
c. If λ is any other eigenvalue of A, then |λ| <= λ_1

# The Perron-Frobenius Theorem
Let A be an irreducible nonnegative nxn matrix. Then A has a real eigenvalue λ_1 with the following properties:
a. λ_1 > 0
b. λ_1 has a corresponding positive eigenvector
c. If λ is any other eigenvalue of A, then |λ| <= λ_1. If A is primitive, then this inequality is strict
d. If λ is an eigenvalue of A such taht |λ| = λ_1, then λ is a (complex) root of the equation λ^n -λ^n_1 = 0
e. λ_1 has algebraic multiplicity 1

** The eigenvalue λ_1 is often called the Perron root of A, and a corresponding probability eigenvector (which is necessarily unique) is called the Perron eigenvector of A

** Binet's formula
If F_n is the n_th Fibonacci number, then
f_n = (1 / root(5)) * ((1+root(5))/2)^n - (1 / root(5)) * ((1-root(5))/2)^n

# Let (x_n) = (x_0, x_1, x_2, ...) be a sequence of numbers that is defined as follows:
1. x_0 = a_0, x_1 = a_1, ... , x_k-1 = a_k-1, where a_0, a_1, ... ,a_k-1 are scalars.
2. For all n>=k, x_n = c_1x_n-1 + c_2x_n-2 + ... + ckx_n-k, where c_1, c_2, ... , c_k are scalars

If c_k != 0, the equation in (2) is called linear recurrence relation of order k. The equation in (1) are referred to as the initial conditions of the recurrence.

# Let x_n = ax_n-1 + bx_n-2 be a recurrence relation that is satisfied by a sequence (x_n).
Let λ_1 and λ_2 be the eigenvalues of the associated characteristic equation λ^2 - aλ -b = 0
a. If λ_1 != λ_2, then x_n = c_1λ^n_1 + c_2λ^n_2 for some scalars c_1 and c_2
b. If λ_1 = λ_2, then x_n = c_1λ^n + c_2nλ^n for some scalars c_1 and c_2
In either case, c_1 and c_2 can be determined using the initial conditions

# Let x_n = a_m-1X_n-1 + a_m-2X_n-2+ ... + a_0X_n-m be a recurrence relation of order m that is satisfied by a sequence (x_n).
Suppose the associated characteristic polynomial
λ^m - a_m-1λ^m-1 - a_m-2λ^m-2 - ... - a_0
factors as (λ-λ_1)^m_1(λ-λ_2)^m_2 ... (λ-λ_k)^m_k, where m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_k = m.
Then x_n has the form
x_n = (c_11*λ^n_1 + C_12*n*λ^n_1 + ... + c_(1m_1)*n^(m_1-1)*λ^(n)_1) + ... + (c_k1*λ^n_k + c_k2*n*(λ^n)_k + ... + c_km_k * n^(m_k-1) * (λ^n)_k)

# Systems of Linear Differential Equations
A system of linear differential equations is a set of linear equations relating a group of functions to their derivatives. 
Because they involve functions and their derivatives, each of these linear equations is itself a differential equation.

# Let A be an nxn diagonalizable matrix and let P = [v_1  v_2   ...  v_n] be such that
P^-1AP
Then the general solution to the system x' = Ax is
x = C_1*e^λ_1t*v1 + ... + C_n*e^λ_nt*vn

# Let A be an nxn diagonalizable matrix with eigenvalues λ_1,λ_2, .. , λ_n. 
Then the general solution to the system x'=Ax is x = e^At * c, where c is an arbitary constant vector.
If an inital condition x(0) is specified, then c=x(0)

# Discrete Linear Dynamical Systems
A discrete dynamical system is a dynamical system whose state evolves over state space in discrete time steps according to a fixed rule.
fomed x_(k+1) = Ax_k

**** In complex space)
# Let A = |a  -b|
          |b   a|. Then eigenvalues of A are λ = a +- bi, and if a and b are not both zero, then A can be factored as
          
A = |a  -b| = |r  0| |cosθ   -sinθ|
    |b   a|   |0  r| |sinθ    cosθ|
where r = |λ| = root(a^2 + b^2) and θ is the principal argments of a+bi


# Let A be a real 2x2 matrix with a complex eigenvalue λ = a - bi (where b != 0)
and corresponding eigenvector x. Then the matrix P = |Re x   Im x| is invertible and
A = P|a  -b|P^-1
     |b   a|
     
** Re x = |a| = |Re z|   <-- check textbook
          |b|   |Re w|
         
** Im x = |c| = |Im z|
          |d|   |Im w|
