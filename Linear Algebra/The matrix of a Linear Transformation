## Let V and W be a two finite-dimensional vetor spaces with bases B and C, respectively, where B = {v_1, ... , v_n}.
If T:V --> W is a linear transformation, then the mxn matrix A defined by
A = [[T(v_1)]_C : [T(v_2)]_C : ... : [T(v_n)]_C]
satisfies A[v]_B = T(v)]_C for every vector v in V


## Let U,V and W be finite-dimensional vector spaces with bases B,C and D, respectively.
Let T:U -->V and S:V --> W be linear transformations. Then
[S∘T]_D<--B = [S]_D<--C[T]_C<--B


## Let T:V --> W be a linear transformation between n-dimensinal vector spaces V and W and let B and C be bases for V and W, respectively.
Then T is invertibel if and only if the matrix [T]_C<--B is invertible. In the case,
([T]_C<--B)^-1 = [T^-1]_B<--C


## Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space with bases B and C and let T:V --> V be linear transformation. Then
[T]_C = P^-1[T]_BP
where P is the change-of-basis matrix from C to B


## Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space and let T:V-->V be a linear transformation.
Then T is called diagonalizable if there is a basis C for V such that the matrix [T]_C is a diagonal matrix


## Homogeneous Linear Differential Equations
A differential equation of the form
y' + ay = 0
is called a first-order, homogeneous, linear differential equation
A solution to y' + ay = 0 is a differentiable funtion y = y(t) that satisfies this equation for all values of t

# The set S of all solutions to y'+ay =0 is a subspace of F
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-space

# If S is the solution space of y' + ay = 0, then
dim S = 1 and {e^-at} is a basis for S

# Let S be the solution space of
y'' + ay' + by = 0
and let λ_1 and λ_2 be tge roots of the characteristic equation λ^2 + aλ + b = 0
a. If λ_1 != λ_2, then {e^(λ_1t), e^(λ_2t)} is a basis for S
b. If λ_1 = λ_2, then {e^(λ_1t), te^(λ_1t)} is a basis for S

# Linear Codes
A p-ary linear code is a subspace C of Z^(n)_p
If p = 2, then it is binary linear codes
If a linear code C is a k-dimensional subspace of Z^(n)_2, then we say that C is an (n,k) code

# The (first-order) Reed-Muller codes R_n are defined indeuctively as follows:
1. For n=0, R_0 = Z_2 = {0,1}
2. For n>-1, R_n is the subspace of Z^(2n)_2 whose basis consists of all vectors of the form
|u| and |0|
|u|     |1|
where u is a basis vector in R_(n-1), 0 is the zero vector in Z^(2^(n-1))_2, and 1 is the vector of 1s in Z^(2^(n-1))_2

# For n>=1, the Reed-Muller code R_n is a (2^n, n+1) linear code in which every code vector except 0 and 1 has weight 2^(n-1)
