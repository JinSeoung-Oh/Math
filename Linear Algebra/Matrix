## A matrix is a rectangluar array of numbers called the entries, or elements,of the matrix

## 
A = |a_11 a_12 ... a_1n|
    |a_21 a_22 ... a_2n|
    ...
    |a_m1 a_m2 ... a_mn|

## Diagonal entris of A are a_11, a_22, ... , a_mn And if m=n then A is called Square matrix
## A square matrix whose nonidaonal entries are all zero is called a diagonal matrix
## A diagonal matrix all of whose diagonal entries are the same is called a scalar matrix
## If the scalar on the diagonal is 1, the scalar matrix is called an identity matrix

## Let A ba an nxm matrix, e_i a 1xm standard unit vector, and e_j an nx1 standard unit vector. Then
a. e_iA is the i th row of A
b. Ae_j is the j th column of A
