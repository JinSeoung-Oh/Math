## Markov chain(finite) represents an enolving process consisting of a finite number of states. 
At each step or point in time, the process may be in any one of the states; at the next step, the proess can remain in its present
state or switch to one of the other states.

In Markov chain, vector x_k are called the state vectors
then x_k can be Px_k-1. And P is called its transition matrix
** X_k+1 = PX_k for k = 0,1,2,...

X_k, Nonnegative components that add up to 1, are called provability vectors
If the columns of P are probability vectors, any square matrix with this property is called a stochastic matrix
** X_k = P^kX_0 for k = 0,1,2,...

## If G is a graph with n vertices, then its adjacency matrix is the nxn matrix A [or A(G)] defined by
      
       1 if there is an edge between vectices i and j
a_ij = 0 otherwise


## If G is a digraph with n vertices, then its adjacency matrix is the nxn matrix A [or A(G)] defined by 

       1 if there is an edge between vectices i and j
a_ij = 0 otherwise

**digraph : A graph with directed edges


## If k<n, then any nxk matrix of the form G = |I_k|
                                               | A |, where A is an (n-k) x K matrix over Z_2(linear algebra over Z_2), is called a
   standard generator matrix for an (n,k) binary code T:Zk_2 --> Zn_2. Any (n-k) x n matrix of the form P = [B I_n-k], whre B is an (n-k)xk matrix over
   Z_z, is called standard parity check matrix. The code is said to have length n and dimension k
