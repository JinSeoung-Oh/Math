## A transformation T:R^n --> R^n is called a linear transformation if
1. T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v) for all u and v in R^n
2. T(cv) = cT(v) for all v in R^n and all scalars c

## T:R^n --> R^m is a linear transformation if
T(c1v1+c2v2) = c1T(v1) + c2T(v2) for all v1, v2 in R^n and scalars c1,c2

## Let A be an mxn matrix, then tje matrix transformation T_A:R^n --> R^m defined by
T_A(x) = Ax (for x in R^n) is a linear transformation

## Let T:R^n --> R^m be a linear tramsformation. Then T is a matrix transformation.
More specifially, T=T_A, where A is the mxn matrix
A = [T(e_1) : T(e_2) : ... : T(e_n)]

## Let T:R^m --> R^n and S:R^n --> R^p be linear transformation. Then S∘T : R^m --> R^p
is a linear transformation. Moerover, their standard matrices are related by
[S∘T] = [S][T]

## Let S and T be linear transformation from R^n to R^n. Then S and T are inverse transformation
if S∘T = I_n and T∘s = I_n

## Let T:R^n --> R^n be an invertible linear transformation. Then its standard matrix [T} is
an invertible matrix, and [T^-1] = [T]^-1
