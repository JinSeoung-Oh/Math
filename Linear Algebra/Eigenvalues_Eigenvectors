## Let A be an nxn matrix. A scalar λ is called an eigenvalue of A if there is a nonzero
vecot x such taht Ax = λx. Such a vector x is called an eigenvector of A corresponding to λ.


## Let A be an nxn matrix and let λ be an eigenvalue of A. the collection of all eigenvectors corresponding to λ,
together with the zero vector, is called the eigenspace of λ and is denoted by E_λ


## The eigenvalues of a square matrix A are precisely the solutions λ of the equation
det(A - Iλ) = 0


## Let A be an nxn matrix
1. Compute the characteristic polynomial det(A-Iλ) of A
2. Find the eigenvalues of A by solving the characteristic equation det(A - Iλ) = 0
3. For each eigenvalue λ, find the null space of the matrix A - λI. This is the eigenspace E_λ,
the nonzero vector of which are the eigenvectors of A corresponding to λ
4. Find a basis for each eigenspace

## The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial (i.e., the polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues of a matrix)
## The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the dimension of the linear space of its associated eigenvectors (i.e., its eigenspace)


## The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the entries on its main diagonal
## A square matrix A is invertible if and only if 0 is not an eignevalue of A


## Let A be a square matrix with eigenvalue λ amd corresponding eigenvector x
a. For any positive integer n, λ^n is an eigenvalue of A^n with corresponding eigenvector x
b. If A is invertible, then 1/λ is an eignevalue of A^-1 with corresponding eigenvector x
c. If A is invertible, then for any interger n, λ^n is an eigenvelue of A^n with corresponding eigenvector x


## Suppose the nxn matrix A has eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vm with corresponding eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ... , λm. If x is a vecotor in R^n taht can be expressed as a linear combination of 
thes eigenvectors
x = c1v1 + c2v2+ ... + cmvm
then, for any integer k,
A^kx = c1λ^k1v1 + c2λ^k2v2 + ... + cmλ^kmvm


## Let A be an nxn matrix and let λ1, λ2, ... , λm be distinct eigenvalues of A with corresponding eigenvectors v1, v2, ... , vm. 
Then v1, v2, ... ,vm are linearly independent
