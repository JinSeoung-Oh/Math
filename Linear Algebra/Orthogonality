## Orthogonality
A set of vectors {v_1, v_2, ... , v_k} in R^n is called an orthogonal set if all pairs of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal - that is, if
v_i ⋅ v_j = 0, whenever i != j for i,j = 1,2, ... , k


## If {v_1, v_2, ... , v_k} is an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in R^n, then these vectors are linearly independent


## An orthogonal basis for a subspace W of R^n is a basis of W that is an orthogonal set


## Let {v_1, v_2, ... , v_k} be an orthogonal basis for a subspace W of R^n and let w be a any vector in W. Then the unique scalars c_1, ... , c_k such that
w = c_1v_1 + ... + c_kv_k
are given by
c_i = w ⋅ v_i / v_i ⋅ v_i for i = 1, ... , k


## A set of vectors in R^n is an orthonormal set if it is an orthogonal set of unit vectors. An orthonormal basis for a subspace W of R^n is a basis of W that is an orthonormal set


## Let {q_1, ... , q_k} be an orthonormal basis for a subspace W of R^n and let w be any vector in W. Then
w = (w ⋅ q_1)q_1 + (w ⋅ q_2)q_2 + ... + (w ⋅  q_k)q_k
and this representation is unique
--> c_1 = ( w ⋅ v_1 / v_1 ⋅ v_1) = w ⋅ v_1 = w ⋅ q_1


## The columns of an mxn matrix Q form an orthonormal set if and only if Q^TQ = I_n


## An nxn matrix Q whose columns form an orthonormal set is called an orthogonal matrix


## A square matrix Q is orthogonal if and only if Q^-1 = Q^T


## Let Q be an nxn matrix. The following statements are equivalent:
a. Q is orthogonal
b. ||Qx|| = ||x|| for every x in R^n
c. Qx ⋅ Qy = x ⋅ y for every x and y in R^n


## If Q is an orthogonal matrix, then its rows form an orthonormal set.


## Let Q be an orthogonal matrix
a. Q^-1 is orthogonal
b. det Q = +-1
c. If λ is an eigenvalue of Q, then |λ| = 1
d. If Q_1 and Q_2 are orthogonal nxn matrices, then so is Q_1Q_2
