# Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to define angles ω in inner product spaces between two vectors x, y, and this notion coincides with our
  intuition in R^2 and R^3. 
  Assume that x ̸= 0, y ̸= 0. Then −1 ⩽ (<x, y> /∥x∥∥y∥) ⩽ 1
  Therefore, there exists a unique ω ∈ [0, π],
  cos ω = (<x, y>/(∥x∥ ∥y∥))

## Angle between Vectors ## 
Let us compute the angle between x = [1, 1]⊤ ∈ R2 and y = [1, 2]⊤ ∈ R2; 
Then
cos ω =((<x, y>) / np.root(<x, x> <y, y>) = x^⊤y/(np.root(x^⊤xy^⊤y))
and the angle between the two vectors is arccos(cos ω)

## Orthogonality ##
Two vectors x and y are orthogonal if and only if <x, y> = 0, and we write x ⊥ y. 
If additionally ∥x∥ = 1 = ∥y∥, i.e., the vectors are unit vectors, then x and y are orthonormal.
An implication of this definition is that the 0-vector is orthogonal to
every vector in the vector space
Orthogonality is the generalization of the concept of perpendicularity to bilinear forms that do not have to be the dot product

# Orthogonal Vectors
Consider two vectors x = [1, 1]⊤, y = [−1, 1]⊤ ∈ R^2
Using the dot product as the inner product yields
an angle ω between x and y of 90◦, such that x ⊥ y.
Vectors that are orthogonal
with respect to one inner product do not have to be orthogonal with respect to a different inner product.
