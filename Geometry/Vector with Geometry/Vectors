## Scalars vs Vector
Scalars - Quantity can be specified by giving a sing number (ex. length, mass, volume, and electric charge)
Vectors - Quantity which require both a magnitude and a direction for complete specification (ex. velocity, force, torque and displacment)
          and it represent arrows
 -1. THe length of the arrow represents the magnitude(or length of vector)
     -Tail
     -Head
 -2. Its direction is the direction of the vector
 -3. If given two vectors has same magnitude and direction, then thoes vector are considered to be equivalent
