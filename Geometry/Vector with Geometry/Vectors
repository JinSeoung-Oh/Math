## Scalars vs Vector
Scalars - Quantity can be specified by giving a sing number (ex. length, mass, volume, and electric charge)
Vectors - Quantity which require both a magnitude and a direction for complete specification (ex. velocity, force, torque and displacment)
          and it represent arrows
 -1. THe length of the arrow represents the magnitude(or length of vector)
     -Tail
     -Head
 -2. Its direction is the direction of the vector
 -3. If given two vectors has same magnitude and direction, then thoes vector are considered to be equivalent

## Algebraic Approach to Vectors
If u = <u1, u2, u3> and v = <v1, v2, v3> in three-space, then
cu= uc = <cu1, cu2, cu3>
-u = (-1)u = <-u1, -u2, -u3>
u+v = <u1+v1, u2+v2, u3+v3>
u-v = u+(-1)v = <u1-v1, u2-v2, u3-v3>

Standard unit vectors(or basis vectors) of three-space is
i = <1,0,0>
j = <0,1,0>
k = <0,0,1>
Then,
u = <u1,u2,u3> = u1i + u2j +u3k

Magnitude of vector is
||u|| = np.root((u1-0)^2+(u2-0)^2+(u3-0)^2) = np.root(u1^2+u2^2+u3^3)

## unit vector
A vector having length one is called a unit vector
