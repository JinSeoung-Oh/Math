## Polar Coordinate
   A fixed half-line, called the polar axis, emanating from a fixed point O, called the pole or origin
   By custom, the polar axis is chosen to be horizontal and pointing to the right and may therefor be identified with
   the positive x-axis in the rectangular coordinate system

   Any point P(Other than the pole) is the intersection of a unique circle with center at O and a unique ray
   emanating from O. If r is the radius of the circle and cepta is one of the angles that the ray makes with the polar axis,
   then (r, cepth) is a pair of polar coordinates for P.

   *Each point has infinitely many sets of polar coordinates, due to the fact that the angles have the same terminal side.

## Polar Equations
   Polar equations, like rectangular ones, are best visualized from their graphs.
   The graph of a polar equation is the set of points each of which has at least one pair of polar coordinates that satisfies the equation.

   *A set of coordinates having its corresponding point on the graph of an equation is no guarantee that these coordinates satisfy the equation

## Relation to Cartesian Coordinates
   Suppose that the polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis of the Cartesian system. 
   Then the polar coordinates (r, cepth) of a point P and the Cartesian coordinates(x,y) of the same point are 
   related by the equations

   Ex) Polar to Cartesian | Cartesian to Polar
       x = r cos cepth    | r^2 = x^2+y^2
       y = r sin cepth    | tan(cepth) = y/x

## Polar Equations for Lines, Circles and Conics
# Line
  If a line passes through the pole, it has the simple equation cepth = cepth_0. if the line does not go through the pole,
  it is some distance d>0 from it. Let cepth_0 be the angle from the polar axis to the perpendicular from the pole
  to the given line. Then if P(r,cepth) is any point on the line, cos(cepth-cepth_0) = d/r
  or
  Line: r = d/cos(cepth-cepth_0)
# Circles
  If a circle of radius a is centered at the pole, its equation is simply r = a.
  If it is centered at (r_0, cepth_0), its equation is quite complicated unless we choose r_0 = a
  Then, by the Law of Cosines, a^2 = r^2+a^2-2ra cos(cepth - cepth_0), 
  Circle: r = 2a cos(cepth-cepth_0)
# Conic
  The cases cepth_0 = 0  and cepth_0 = np.pi/2 are particularly nice.
  The first gives r=2a cos(cepth); 
  The second gives r=2a cos(cepth - np.pi/2(l
  That is, r = 2a sin(cepth).
  Finally, if a conic(ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) is placed so that its focus is
  at the pole and its directrixis is d units away, then the familiar defining equation |PF| = e|PL| takes the form
  r = e[d- r cos(cepth-cepth_0)]
  or
  Conic : r = ed/(1+e cos(cepth-cepth_0))

## Graphs of Polar Equations
   1. The graph of a polar equation is symmetric about the x-axis(the polar axis)
      if replacing (r, cepta) by (r, -cepta) (or by (-r, np.pi-cepta))
   2. The graph of a polar equation is symmetric about the y-axis(the line cepta = np.pi/2)
      if replacing (r, cepta) by (-r, -cepta) (or by (r, np.pi-cepta))
   3. The graph of a polar equation is symmetric about the origin(pole)
      if replacing (r, cepta) by (-r, cepta) (or by (r, np.pt+cepta))

## Cardioids and Limacons
   We consider equations of the form
   r = a +- b cos cepta       r = a +- sin cepta
   with a and b positive. Their graph are called limacons, with the special cases in a=b referred to as cardioids

## Lemniscats
   The graphs of 
   r^2 = +-a cos2(cepta)    r^2 = +-a sin2(cepta)
   are figure-eight-shaped urves called lemniscates

## Roses
   Polar equations of the form
   r = a cos n(cepta)   r = a sin n(cepta)
   represent flower-shaped curves called roses. The rose has n leaves if n is odd and 2n leaves if n is even

## Spirals
   The graph of r = a(cepta) is called a spiral of Archmeds
   The graph of r = ae^(b0) is called a logarithmic spiral

## Area in Polar Coordinates
   Let r = f(cepta) determine a curve in the plane, where f is a continuous, nonnegative function for
   A <= cepta <= B and B-A <= 2(np.pi). The curves r = f(cepta), cepta = A, and cepta = B bound a regin R
   Then with the Squeeze Theorem
   The area formula
   A = (1/2) integral (A to B) [f(cepta)]^2 d(cepta)
