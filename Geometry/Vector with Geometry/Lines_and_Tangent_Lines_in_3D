## Direction vector
A line is determined by a fixed point p_0 and a fixed vector v=ai+bj+ck called the direction vector for the line
It is the set of all points P such that vector(P_0P) is parallel to v, that is that satisfy
vector(P_0P) = tv for some real number t. 
If r = vector(OP) and r_0 = vector(OP_0) are position vectors of P and P_0, respectively, the vector(P_0P) = r-r_0, and the equation of the
line can thus be written
r = r_0 + tv
if we write r = <x,y,z> and r_0 = <x_0, y_0, z_0> and equate components in the last equation above, we obtain
x = x_0 + at, y= y_0 + bt, z = z_0 + ct
Theses are parametric equations of the line through (x_0, y_0, z_0) and parllel to v = <a,b,c>
The numbers a,b, and c are called diretion numbers for the line

## Symmetric equations
If we solve each of the parametric equations for t(assuming that a,b and c are all different from zero)
and equate the result, two obtain the symmetric equations for the line through(x_0, y_0, z_0) with direction numbers a,b,c
(x-x_0)/a = (y-y_0)/b = (z-z_0)/c
"This is the conjunction of the two equations"
(x-x_0)/a = (y-y_0)/b and (y-y_0)/b = (z-z_0)/c

## Curvature
Measures how sharply a cureve bends at a given point
Let r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k denote the position of an object at time t.
We will assume that r'(t) is continuous and that r'(t) is never equal to the zero vector.
This last condition assures that the accumulated arc length s(t) increases as t increases.
The measure of curvature is going to involve how fast the tangent vector is changing
Rather than working with the tangent vector r'(t) we choose to work with the unit tangent vecor
T(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| = v(t) / ||v(t)||

Curvatur k is the magnitude of the rage of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to the arc length s
k = ||dT/ds||

Spped = ||v(t)|| = ds/dt
Since s increases at t increases we can apply the Inverse Function Theorem to conclude that the inverse of s(t) exists and
dt/ds = 1/(ds/dt) = 1/||v(t)||
So,
k = ||dT/ds|| = ||dT/dt dt/ds|| = |dt/ds| ||dT/dt|| = [1/||v(t)||]||T'(t)|| = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||
