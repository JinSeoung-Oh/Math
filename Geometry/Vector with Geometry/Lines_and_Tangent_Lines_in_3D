## Direction vector
A line is determined by a fixed point p_0 and a fixed vector v=ai+bj+ck called the direction vector for the line
It is the set of all points P such that vector(P_0P) is parallel to v, that is that satisfy
vector(P_0P) = tv for some real number t. 
If r = vector(OP) and r_0 = vector(OP_0) are position vectors of P and P_0, respectively, the vector(P_0P) = r-r_0, and the equation of the
line can thus be written
r = r_0 + tv
if we write r = <x,y,z> and r_0 = <x_0, y_0, z_0> and equate components in the last equation above, we obtain
x = x_0 + at, y= y_0 + bt, z = z_0 + ct
Theses are parametric equations of the line through (x_0, y_0, z_0) and parllel to v = <a,b,c>
The numbers a,b, and c are called diretion numbers for the line

## Symmetric equations
If we solve each of the parametric equations for t(assuming that a,b and c are all different from zero)
and equate the result, two obtain the symmetric equations for the line through(x_0, y_0, z_0) with direction numbers a,b,c
(x-x_0)/a = (y-y_0)/b = (z-z_0)/c
"This is the conjunction of the two equations"
(x-x_0)/a = (y-y_0)/b and (y-y_0)/b = (z-z_0)/c

## Curvature
Measures how sharply a cureve bends at a given point
Let r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k denote the position of an object at time t.
We will assume that r'(t) is continuous and that r'(t) is never equal to the zero vector.
This last condition assures that the accumulated arc length s(t) increases as t increases.
The measure of curvature is going to involve how fast the tangent vector is changing
Rather than working with the tangent vector r'(t) we choose to work with the unit tangent vecor
T(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| = v(t) / ||v(t)||

Curvatur k is the magnitude of the rage of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to the arc length s
k = ||dT/ds||

Spped = ||v(t)|| = ds/dt
Since s increases at t increases we can apply the Inverse Function Theorem to conclude that the inverse of s(t) exists and
dt/ds = 1/(ds/dt) = 1/||v(t)||
So,
k = ||dT/ds|| = ||dT/dt dt/ds|| = |dt/ds| ||dT/dt|| = [1/||v(t)||]||T'(t)|| = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||

## Radius and Center of Curvature for a Plane Curve
Let P be a point on a plane curve(i.e., a curve lying entirely in the xy-plane) where the curvature is nonzero.
Consider the circle that is tangent to the curve at P which has the same curvature there. 
Its center will lie on the concave side of the curve. This circle is called the circle of curvature or osculating circle
It radius R = 1/k is called the radius of curvature and its center is the center of curvature

## Other Formulas for curvature of a plane curve
Let /a/ denote the angle measured counterclockwise from i to T. Then,
T = cos/a/i + sin/a/j
and so
dT/(d/a/) = -sin/a/i + cos/a/j
Now dT/(d/a/) is a unit vector and T·dT/(d/a/) = 0. Moreover,
k = ||dT/ds|| = ||dT/(d/a/) (d/a/)/ds|| = ||dT/(d/a/)|| |(d/a/)/ds| = |(d/a/)/ds|

## Theorem A
Consider a curve with vector equation r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j. That is, with parametric equation x = f(t) and y = g(t). Then,
k = (|x'y'' - y'x''|) / [(x')^2 + (y')^2]^(3/2)
In particular, if the curve is the graph of y = g(x), then
k = |y''| / [1+(y')^2]^(3/2)

## Components of Acceleration
For motion along the curve with position vector r(t), the unit tangent vector is T(t) = r'(t)/||r'(t)||. This vector satisfies
T(t)·T(t) = 1
for all t. Differentiating both side with respect to t, and using the product rule on the left side.
T(t)·T'(t) + T(t)·T'(t) = 0
This reduces to T(t)·T'(t) = 0 telling us that T(t) and T'(t) are perpendicular for all t.
In general, T' is not a unit vector, so we define the principal unit normal vector to be
N(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||

*Tangential
a_t = d^2s / dt^2

*Normal components of acceleration
a_n = (ds/dt)^2 k

Then,
N = (a - a_tT) / a_N, a is vector (N+T)

## Vector forms for the components of acceleration
a = a_tT + a_nN
From this, curvature k is
k = (a_n)/(ds/dt)^2 = (||r' x r''|| / ||r'||) / ||r'||^2 = (||r' X r''||) / ||r'||^3

## Binormal at P 
Given a curve C and the unit tangent vector T at P, there are, of course, infinitely many unit vectors perpendiculara to T at P.
We picked one of them, N = T'/||T'||, and called it the principal normal.
The vector
B = T X N is called the binormal
It, too, is a unit vector and it is perpendicular to both T and N
If the unit tangent vector T, the principal normal N, and the binormal B have their inital points at p, they form a right-handed,
mutually perpendicular triple of unit vectors known as trihedral at P. This moving trihedral plays a crucial role in a subject
called differential geometry. The plan of T and N is called the osculating plane at P
