## Cross sections & Traces
The graph of an equation in three variables is normally a surface
The graph of Ax + By + Cz = D is a plane
The graph of (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 + (z-l)^2 = r^2 is a sphere
Graphing surfaces is best accomplished by finding the intersections of the surface with well-chosen planes
These intersections are called cross sections; those with the coordinate planes are also called traces
If the surface is very complicated, it may be useful to show the corss sections with many planes parallel to the coorinate planes.

Ex. x^2/16 + y^2/25 + z^2/9 = 1
    Then xy-plane
    x^2/16 + y^2/25 = 1

## Cylinders
Let C ba a plane curve, and let L be a line intersecting C that is not in the plane of C.
The set of all points on lines that are parallel to L and that intersect C is called a cylinder
Given that
y^2/a^2 - x^2/b^2 = 1
in which the variable z is missing. This equation determines a curve C in the xy-plane, a hyperbola.
Moreover, if (x_1, y_1, 0) satisfies the equation, so dose (x_1, y_1, z).
As z runs through all real values, the point(x_1, y_1, z) traces out a line parallel to the z_axis.
We conclude that the graph of the given equation is a bylinder, a hyper-bolic cylunder

## Quadric Surfaces
If a surface is the graph in three-space of an equation of second degree, it is called a quadric surface.
Plane sections of a quadric surface are conics.
The general second-degree equation has the form
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0
It can be shown that any such equation can be reduced, by rotation and translation of coordinate axes, 
to one of the two forms
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + j = 0
or
Ax^2 + By^2 + Iz = 0

The quadric surfaces represented by the first of these equations are symmetric with respect to the coordinate planes and the origin
They are called central quadrics.

## Cylindrical coordinate system 
The sylindrical coordinate system uses the polar coordinates r and cepth in place of Cartesian coordiantes x and y in the plane.
The z-coordinate is the same as in Cartesian coordinates.
A point P has spherical coordinates (rho, cepth, phi) if rho is the distance |OP| from the origin to P, cepth is the polar angle associated with the projection P' of P
onto the xy-plane, and phi is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line segment OP. We require that
rho >= 0 , 0 <= cepth < 2π , 0 <= phi <= π

## Cylindrical coordinates
If a solid or a surface has an axis of symmetry, it is often wise to orient it so that this axis is the z-axis and then use cylindrical coordinates.
Note in particular the simplicity of the equation of a circluar cylinder with z-axis symmetry and also of a plane containing the z-axis.
We have allowded r < 0.

## Spherical coordinates 
When a solid or a surface is symmetric with respect to a point, spherical coordinates are likely to play a simplifying role.
In particular, a sphere cente
