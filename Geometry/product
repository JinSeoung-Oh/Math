## Dot Product
The scalar product/dot product in R^n, which is given by
x⊤y =[sigma i=1 to i=n] x_iy_i
* A particular type of inner product
* Inner products are more general concepts with specific properties

## Inner Products
Inner products allow for the introduction of intuitive geometrical concepts, 
such as the length of a vector and the angle or distance between
two vectors. A major purpose of inner products is to determine whether
vectors are orthogonal to each other

## General Inner Products
A bilinear mapping Ω is a mapping with two arguments, and it is linear in
each argument. when we look at a vector space V then it holds that
for all x, y, z ∈ V, λ, ψ ∈ R that
* Ω(λx + ψy, z) = λΩ(x, z) + ψΩ(y, z)
* Ω(x, λy + ψz) = λΩ(x, y) + ψΩ(x, z)

Definition
Let V be a vector space and Ω : V × V → R be a bilinear
mapping that takes two vectors and maps them onto a real number. Then
* Ω is called symmetric if Ω(x, y) = Ω(y, x) for all x, y ∈ V , i.e., the order of the arguments does not matter
* Ω is called positive definite if
  ∀x ∈ V \{0} : Ω(x, x) > 0 , Ω(0, 0) = 0

Definition
Let V be a vector space and Ω : V × V → R be a bilinear
mapping that takes two vectors and maps them onto a real number. Then
* A positive definite, symmetric bilinear mapping Ω : V ×V → R is called
  an inner product on V . We typically write ⟨x, y⟩ instead of Ω(x, y)
* The pair (V,⟨·, ·⟩) is called an inner product space or (real) vector space
  with inner product. If we use the dot product, we call (V,⟨·, ·⟩) a Euclidean vector space

Inner Product That Is Not the Dot Product
Consider V = R^2. If we define
⟨x, y⟩ := x_1y_1 − (x_1y_2 + x_2y_1) + 2(x_2y_2)
then ⟨·, ·⟩ is an inner product but different from the dot product

## Cross Product
The corss product uxv of u=<u1,u2,u3> and v=<v1,v2,v3> is defined
uxv = <u2v3-u3v2, u3v1-u1v3, u1v2-u2v1>

-Torque
Let O be a fixed point in a body, and suppose that a force F is applied at another point P of the body
Then F tends to rotate the body about an axis through O and perpendicular to the plane of OP and F.
The vector t = -->
               OP x F
is called the torque. It points in the dirction of the axis and has magnitude ----->
                                                                              ||OP|| ||F|| sin(ceptha), which is just
the moment of force about the axis due to F

*Theorem A
Let u and v be vectors in thress-space and cepth be the angle between them. Then
1. u·(uxv) = 0 = v(uxv), that is, uxv is perpendicular to both u and v
2. u,v and uxv form a right-haded triple
3. ||uxv|| = ||u||||v|| sin(cepta)

*Theorem B
Two vectors u and v in three-space are parallel if and only if uxv=0
-Can find equation of the plane using cross product
-Recall that the area of a parallelogram is the product of the base times the height, then ||axb||=||a||||b|| sin(ceptha)

*Theorem C
Algebraic Properties
If u,v and w are vectors in three-space and k is a scalar, then
1. uxv = -(vxu) = anticommultative law
2. ux(v+w) = (uxv)+(uxw) = left distributive law)
3. k(uxv) = (ku)xv = ux(kv)
4. ux0 = 0xu = 0, uxu = 0
5. (uxv)·w = u·(vxw)
6. ux(vxw) = (u·w)v-(u·v)w
