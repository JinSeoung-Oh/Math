## Definition
For any unit vector u, let
D_uf(p) = lim h->0 [(f(p+hu)-f(p)) / h]
This limit, if it exists, is called the directional derivative of f at p in the direction u

## Connection with the Gradient
∇f(p) = f_x(p)i + f_y(p)j

Theorem A
Let f be differentiabel at p. Then f has a directional derivative at p in the direction of the unit vector u = u_1i + u_2j and
D_uf(p) = uㆍ∇f(p)
That is,
D_uf(x,y) = u_1f_x(x,y) + u_2f_y(x,y)

## Maximum rate of change
For a given function f at a given point p, it is natural to ask in what direction the function is changing most rapidly, that is,
in what direction is D_uf(p) the largest? From the geometric formula for the dot product, we may write
D_uf(p) =  uㆍ∇f(p) = ||u|| ||∇f(p)||cos(cepth) = ||∇f(p)||cos(cepth)
where (cepth) is the angle between u and ∇f(p). Thus, D_uf(p) is maximized when (cepth)=0 and minimized when (cepth)=pi. 

Theorem B
A function increases most repidly at p in the direction of the gradient(with rate ||∇f(p)||) and decreases most
repidly in the opposite direction (with rate -||∇f(p)||)

## Level Curves and Gradients
Denote by L the level curve of f(x,y) that passes throught an arbitarily chosen point P(x_0,y_0) in the domain of f,
and let the unit vector u be tangent to L at P.
Since the value of f is the same at all points on the level curve L, its directional derivative D_uf(x_0,y_0), which
is the rate of change of f(x,y) in the direction u, is zero when u is tangent to L.
Since
0 = D_uf(x_0,y_0) = ∇f(p)ㆍu
we conclude that ∇f and u are perpendicular

Theroem C
The gradient of f at a point P is perpendicular to the level curve of f that goes throught P.

## Higher Dimensions
The concept of level curve for functions of two variables generalizes to level surfaces for functions of three variables.
If f is a function of three variables, that surface f(x,y,z) = k, where k is a onstant, is a level surface for f.
At all points on a level surface, the value of the funtion is the same, and the gradient vector of f(x,y,z) at a point P(x,y,z)
in its domain is normal to the level surface of f that goes throught P
In problems of heat conduction in a homogeneous body, where w= f(x,y,z) gives the temperauture at the point(x,y,z), the level surface 
f(x,y,z) = k is called an isothermal surface because all points on it have the same temperature k.
At any given point of the body, heat flows in the direction opposite to the gradient and therefore perpendicular to the isothermal surface
throught the point. If w=f(x,y,z) gives the electrostatic potential(voltage) at any point in an electric potential field, the level
surfaces of the function are called equipotential surfaces. All point on an equipotential surface have the same electrostatic potential,
and the direction of flow of electricity is along the negative gradient, that is, in the direction of greatest drop in potential
