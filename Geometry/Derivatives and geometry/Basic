## Pre
Real valued function of wo real variables, that is, a function f that assigns to each ordered pair (x,y)
in some set D of the plane a real number f(x,y)
In this, the set D is called the domain of the function
The range of a function is its set of values.
If z = f(x,y), we call x and y the independent variables and z the dependent variable

## Level Curves
Given z = f(x,y)
Each horizontal plane z =c intersects the surface in a curve
The projection of this curve is a contour plot or a contour map

## Isotherms(isothermal curves)
Level curves for equal tempperatures are called isotherms or isothermal curve

## Isoseismic curves
Curves with constant intensity are called isoseismic curves.
