## Definition (Norms)
A norm on a vector space V is a function
  ∥ · ∥ : V → R ,
           x |→ ∥x∥ ,
which assigns each vector x its lengh ||x|| ∈ R, such that for all λ ∈ R length
and x, y ∈ V the following hold
* Absolutely homogeneous: ∥λx∥ = homogeneous |λ|∥x∥
* Triangle inequality: ∥x + y∥ ⩽ ∥x∥ + ∥y∥
* Positive definite: positive definite ∥x∥ ⩾ 0 and ∥x∥ = 0 ⇐⇒ x = 0

## Manhattan Norm
The Manhattan norm on Rn
is defined for x ∈ Rn as Manhattan norm
  ∥x∥_1 := [sigma i=1 to i=n] |x_i|,
where | · | is the absolute value. 
The Manhattan norm is also called "ℓ1 norm"

## Euclidean Norm
The Euclidean norm of x ∈ Rn Euclidean norm is defined as
  ∥x∥_2 := np.root([sigma i=1 to i=n] x^2_i = √(x⊤x)
and computes the Euclidean distance of x from the origin.
The Euclidean norm is also called ℓ2 norm.
