## Epipolar Geometry
Epipolar Gemetry can be thought of as the geometry in stereo vision. It deals with the geometric relationship between
matching pairs of image A and image B when images of the same object or scene are acquired from two different points

If P(in 3D) is given
And p is point which P is projected onto image A
And p' is point which P is projected onto image B
And O is camera center of image A
And O' is camera center of image B

## Epipole
The point e, e' where the line connectiong the two camera origins(O and O') and the image plane(A and B) meet is epipole

## Epililne (or Epipolar line)
The straight line l, l' connecting the projection point and the epipole is called the epiline
It can also be seen as the intersection of the 3D point P and the plane connecting the two camera origins with the image plane.
** We can not uniquely determine the p' which is corresponding point of p, but l'(epiline) which is 
straight line through p' can be determined uniquely

## Esssential Matrix
If p and p' given then, (*p and p' is homogeneous coordination in #normalized image plan) 
 
p'^TEp = 0                 --- (1)

             |u|
[u' v ' 1] E |v| = 0       --- (2)
             |1|  
             
E(Essential matrix) is always exsists. 

*If 3x3 rotation matrix and 3x1 translation vector is given,
then p' = Rp+t
if essential matrix E = [t]_xR
then 
Equation (1) can be
p'^tEp = p'^t[t]_xRp
       = p'·(tx(p'-t))  (RP = p'-t
       = p'·(txp'-txt)
       = 0 
       
p = zp = z[x/z/, y/z, 1] ^t
p' = z'p' = z'[x'/z', y'/z', 1]^t
p'^tEp = 0 <==> (z'p')^teEzp = 0 <==> p'^tEp = 0

## Epipolar constraint
Epipolar constraint is the equation (1) (p'^TEp = 0)


## Fundamental Matrix
A fundamental matrix is a matrix that express the geometric relationship betwwen the
actual pixcel coordinates of two images, including camera parmeters

P_img is the pixcel coordinates of image A and P_img' is the pixcel coordinates of image B
Then
P_img'^tFP_img = 0    ---(3)

            |x|
[x' y' 1] F |y| = 0   ---(4)
            |1|
            
F is always exsits. F called fundaemtal matrix

If K' is calibration matrix of image B and K is calibration matrix of image A
Then
E = K'^tFK
F = (K'^t)^-1EK^-1

If image A and image B is captured by same camera
then, E = K^tFK
      F = (K^t)^-1Ek^-1
      
## Detail of epipolar constraint
When two images are given and the corresponding matching paris are known,
but if the camera parameters are not known, then in order to obtain F, we need at least 7 pairs of matching points
However, it should be noted that the scale of F cannot be determined (E is also the same).
--> Unable to determine the scale means that we cannot determine the scale with only image
    because the same image is obtained even if scale is different

If camera matrix is known, we only get Essential matrix E. 
Normally for obtaining E, five pairs of matching points is needed
--> E is consists of R and t. R has 3 degrees of freedom and t has 2 degrees of freedom. 

## triangulation
If E or F is given, and p and p' is also given
Then we can detrmine 3D coordinatation(original 3D points)
--> It is same in streo vision(when get depth)

** If we get 3D point from triangulation, then we can get Extrinsic parameter / Because K is intrinsic parameter
