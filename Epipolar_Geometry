## Epipolar Geometry
Epipolar Gemetry can be thought of as the geometry in stereo vision. It deals with the geometric relationship between
matching pairs of image A and image B when images of the same object or scene are acquired from two different points

If P(in 3D) is given
And p is point which P is projected onto image A
And p' is point which P is projected onto image B
And O is camera center of image A
And O' is camera center of image B

## Epipole
The point e, e' where the line connectiong the two camera origins(O and O') and the image plane(A and B) meet is epipole

## Epililne (or Epipolar line)
The straight line l, l' connecting the projection point and the epipole is called the epiline
It can also be seen as the intersection of the 3D point P and the plane connecting the two camera origins with the image plane.
** We can not uniquely determine the p' which is corresponding point of p, but l'(epiline) which is 
straight line through p' can be determined uniquely

## Esssential Matrix
If p and p' given then, (*p and p' is homogeneous coordination in #normalized image plan) 
 
p'^TEp = 0                 --- (1)

             |u|
[u' v ' 1] E |v| = 0       --- (2)
             |1|  
             
E(Essential matrix) is always exsists. 

*If 3x3 rotation matrix and 3x1 translation vector is given,
then p' = Rp+t
if essential matrix E = [t]_xR
then 
Equation (1) can be
p'^tEp = p'^t[t]_xRp
       = p'·(tx(p'-t))  (RP = p'-t
       = p'·(txp'-txt)
       = 0 
       
p = zp = z[x/z/, y/z, 1] ^t
p' = z'p' = z'[x'/z', y'/z', 1]^t
p'^tEp = 0 <==> (z'p')^teEzp = 0 <==> p'^tEp = 0

## Epipolar constraint
Epipolar constraint is the equation (1) (p'^TEp = 0)

## Fundamental Matrix
A fundamental matrix is a matrix that express the geometric relationship betwwen the
actual pixcel coordinates of two images, including camera parmeters
