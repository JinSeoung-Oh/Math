## Experiment
In general be thought of as any process or procedure for which more than one outcome is pssible

## Sample Space
The sample space S of an experiment is a set consisting of all of the possible experimental outcomes

## Probabilities
A set of probability values for an experiement with a sample space
S = {O_1, O_2, ... , O_n} consists of some probabilities
p_1, p_2, ... , p_n
tat satisfy
0 <= p_1 <=1, 0<=p_2<=2, ... , 0<=p_n<=1
and
p_1 + ... + p_n =1
The probability of outcome O_i occurring is said to be p_i, and this is written
P(O_i) = p_i

## Event
An event A is a subset of the sample space S. It coellects outcomes of particular interest.
The probability of an event A, P(A), is obtained by summing the probabilities of the outcomes contained within the event A

## Complements of Events
The evet A, the complement of an event A, is the event consisting of everthing in the sample space Sthat is not contained within the event A
In all cases 
P(A) + P(A') = 1

## Intersections of Events
The event A∩B is the intersection of the events A and B and consists of the outcomes that are contained within both event A and B.
The probaility of this event, P(A∩B), is the probaility that both events A and B occur simultaneously

## Mutually Exclusive Events
Two events A and B are said to mutually exclusive if A∩B = {}, so that they have no outcomes in common
